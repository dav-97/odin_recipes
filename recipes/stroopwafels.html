    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> We all love stroopwafels with a cup of coffee or tea - it's a favorite Dutch treat. Try making them at home with
        this recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <b>Waffle:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>41 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <b>filling:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup molasses or black treacle</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, 1 cup melted butter, white sugar, milk, egg, and yeast in a large bowl. Knead until dough is
            smooth and elastic. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat treacle, brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and cinnamon in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted
            together, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix well until filling is smooth.</li>
        <li>Preheat a shallow waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Knead dough briefly and divide it into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, or as needed to fit your waffle
            iron.</li>
        <li>Bake 1 ball of dough the preheated iron until golden brown and iron stops steaming, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
            Remove with a cake spatula. Press down with a round cutter to trim edges for a perfect circle. Carefully
            slice horizontally into 2 rounds while still hot. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling on each round and
            sandwich together. Repeat with remaining dough. </li>
    </ol>
