    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Ollie-bollen, or Oliebollen, are a Dutch pastry similar to a doughnut. It's typically a deep-fried pastry filled
        with raisins and dusted with powdered sugar. Some modern variations serve them topped with berry filling, but
        this is a traditional recipe. Oliebollen are a traditional treat on New Year's.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (0.6 ounce) cake compressed fresh yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ cup dried currants</li>
        <li>¾ cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Break up the compressed yeast, and stir into the warm milk. Let stand for a few minutes to dissolve. Sift
            the
            flour and salt into a large bowl. Stir the yeast mixture and egg into the flour and mix into a smooth
            batter.
            Stir in the currants, raisins and apple. Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise until
            double in size. This will take about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or heavy deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use 2 metal spoons to
            shape
            scoops of dough into balls, and drop them carefully into the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the balls until golden brown, about 8 minutes. The doughnuts should be soft and not greasy. If the oil
            is
            not hot enough, the outside will be tough and the insides greasy. Drain finished doughnuts on paper towels
            and
            dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve them piled on a dish with more confectioners' sugar dusted over them.
            Eat
            them hot if possible.
        </li>
    </ol>
